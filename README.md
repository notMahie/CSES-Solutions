A **comprehensive repository of CSES Problem Set solutions** implemented in **C++**, designed for structured **competitive programming practice** and skill development in **algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques**.


## **Repository Structure**

Solutions are organized according to the **official CSES categories**, enabling a systematic approach to learning and revision:

- **Introductory Problems**
- **Sorting and Searching**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Tree Algorithms**
- **Range Queries**
- **String Algorithms**
- **Mathematics**
- **Geometry**
- **Bitwise Operations**
- **Sliding Window Problems**
- **Counting Problems**
- **Construction Problems**
- **Advanced Techniques**
- **Advanced Graph Problems**
- **Additional Problems I**
- **Additional Problems II**
- **Interactive Problems**

> Each folder includes a dedicated `README.md` detailing the problems, solutions, and insights specific to that category.


## **Goals**

This repository aims to:

- Provide **structured practice** for competitive programming contests  
- Develop a **strong understanding of core algorithms and data structures**  
- Deliver **clean, optimized, and readable C++ implementations**  
- Serve as a **reference and revision tool** for programming contests and technical interviews  


## **Technologies and Concepts**

- **Programming Language:** C++ (C++11 standard or later)  
- **Core Concepts:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Problem-Solving, Competitive Programming  
- **Platform:** [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)  
- **Techniques Applied:** Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Graph Theory, Trees, Bitwise Operations, Sliding Window, Advanced Graph & Mathematical Algorithms  

## **Usage Notes**

- Solutions are implemented with **clarity, efficiency, and readability** in mind  
- This repository is intended solely for **learning and practice purposes**  
- **Problem statements belong to CSES**; only **solution code** is provided  
- Users can **run, modify, and study** the solutions to improve problem-solving skills
